Learning how to develop interactive data visualisations.


Landing page uses source code from this site to create text animation.
Code by Callum Martin, found on:
https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-text-animation/

Main pages are using a Bootstrap 4 Basic Template, found here:
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_templates.asp

Data visualisations were developed using Processing.
The data set was created by collecting clothing labels from my classmates.
I created the data info on google sheets.
I am trying to explore how interaction with information in various ways helps us to have more of a grasp on how we live within'hyper-objects'.
