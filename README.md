Learning how to develop interactive data visualisations.


Landing page uses source code from this site to create text animation.
Code by Callum Martin, found on:
https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-text-animation/

Main pages are using a Bootstrap 4 Basic Template, found here:

Data visualisations were developed using Processing.
The data set was created by collecting clothing labels from my classmates.
I created the data info on google sheets.
I am trying to explore how interaction with information in various ways can helps individuals to have more of a grasp on how we live within'hyper-objects' or systems. 

Geovisualisations we created with illustrator, made into an 'interaction' using javascript events and 'onclick'.
This was a work around after realising unfolding library has not been undated for Processing 4.0.
The sample code for the button onclick change image can be found here:

I have started to look at how to use python, folium and jupyter notebook to make fully interactive geovisualisations.
