  <p class="p-5">The labels that kick off this project were collected from my colleagues in my IxUx Master's programme in the Univeristy of Limerick. As a class we are both actor and network. As a group, we are diverse, having origins in Italy, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Ireland. It was important to me to collect labels from such a varied group as to highlight the entanglments of the global fashion industry. </p>

  <h1>From Label to Data Set</h1>
    <img alt="Primary Data Set" src="/resources/primaryData.png" 
           style="height: auto; max-width: 100%;" id="image"/>
  <p class="p-5">I was guided by the labels in everyway in this project. The data set categories reflect the corresponding information I found on the labels. These categories aided me in spotting outliers and clusters under certain roles. </p>

  <h1>Focusing on Location Mapping</h1>
    <img alt="Location Data Set" src="/resources/locationData.png" 
           style="height: auto; max-width: 100%;" id="image"/>
  <p class="p-5">While building out the data set I was engaged in the distribution of design versus manufacture. It was interesting to me that even though my class had arrived in Limerick from various countries, most of the brand labels design headquarters were clustered in mainland Europe. It shows the global reach of fast fashion brands. The second location cluster came from the 'Made In' information on the labels. This cluster appeared in South East Asia.</p>

  <h1>Simplifying the Data to Tell a Story</h1>

  <p class="p-5">I began to realise to the tell the story of the labels through data meant focusing on segments of the primary data set at a time. This would also aid me in learning how to use data sets to create interactive data visualisations on processing. I realised that there is further data in the primary data that I can access by thinking about 'what is between the lines'. For example, I could roughly calculate what distance the clothes had traveled from design to manufacture to point of purchase based on information I had in my table. This is something I would like to explore further in this project.</p>
